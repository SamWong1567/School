<b>Introduction to arithmetic expressions</b>@
In programming, arithmetic expressions instructs the computer to do calculations@
//referenced from python@

Example:@
Print (1+1)@
Output: 2@

In the example, line 1 is expressed in terms of pseudocode@
*Pseudocode: As the name denotes, pseudocodes are a generic way to represent codes instead of the actual syntax found in programming languages //incomplete@

1+1 Is an example of an arithmetic expression.@
Print is a function which tells the computer computer to output whatever that is found in it’s brackets. In other words, functions are also just another form of instructions for the computer@
Finally, when the program is run, the output will reflect 2 as the result@

Operators@
The following operators are commonly used in programming@

Addition@
Addition would be done using +@
Example@
print(4+2)@
Output: 6@

Operators@
The following operators are commonly used in programming@

Subtraction@
Subtraction would be done using -@
Example@
print(4-2)@
Output: 2@

Operators@
The following operators are commonly used in programming@

Multiplication@
Multiplication would be done using *@
Example@
print(4*2)@
Output: 8@

Operators@
The following operators are commonly used in programming@

Division@
Division would be doing using /@
Example@
print(4/2)@
Output: 2@

Operators@
The following operators are commonly used in programming@

Modulus@
Modulus returns the remainder of the division of 2 numbers@
This would be done using %@
Example@
print(4%2)@
Output: 0@
~
Operator precedence@
Occasionally, we might want a certain operation to take place before the other.@
Consider the following expression:@
2*6+3@
Output: 15@

Technically, multiplication would take place first before the addition.@
What if we wanted the addition to take place first before the multiplication?@
This can be done by using brackets ( )@

2*(6+3)@
Output: 11@
