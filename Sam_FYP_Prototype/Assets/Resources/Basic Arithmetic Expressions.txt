This question attempts to assess the user’s understanding of the operators. To achieve the value of 21 as the first output, the user will have to mod 171 by 50. The second output is to ensure that the user knows what the print() statement does and in this case, it is simply made to output 4. The last output would simply be taking the value of 121 and dividing it by 11.
