When assigning variables names, you should name them appropriately.
True
<color=#757575>Giving variables meaningful names will help you identify what the variables were created for.</color>

The following pseudocodes will not cause an error:
1. int numberOfSongs <- 12
2. int numberOfSongs <- 15
False
<color=#757575>A variable only needs to be declared once. Otherwise, it will cause an error as it will be taken by the computer that you are trying to create an existing variable.</color>

The datatype, boolean, only holds a value of either true or false.
True
<color=#757575>Boolean is not allowed to hold any other values other than true or false.</color>

The following statement will cause an error:
1. char surname <- Jun
True
<color=#757575>char is only allowed to store a SINGLE character and not a sequence of characters.</color>

Variable declaration and assignment can both be done in the same statement.
True
<color=#757575>Rather than having to declare the variable first then assigning it a variable which leads to two statements, we can simply perform both in one step which only require one statement which is more efficient.</color>

Which of the following values should you assign to a variable of datatype int?
1 000 000
2.5
a
true
<color=#757575>int is used for storing integer values which in this case is 1,000,000.</color>

Which datatype should you use when storing a sequence of characters?
String
boolean
char
double
<color=#757575>String datatype is used when storing a chain of characters such as “This is a sentence” while char only stores a SINGLE character such as ‘a’.</color>

What would be the output of the following pseudocode?
1. int x <- 5
2. print(x)

Which of the following are datatypes?
1) int
2) text
3) variable
4) char
1,4
1,2,3,4
1,3,4
1,2,4
<color=#757575>The only datatypes here are int and char. Note that a variable is not a datatype.</color>

Which of the following statements will cause an error?
1. int numberOfDogs <- 3
2. int numberOfCats <- 2
3. totalNumberOfPets <- numberOfDogs + numberOfCats
3
1,2
None of the above
1,2,3
<color=#757575>Statement 3 will cause an error as the variable totalNumberOfPets, is not declared to be of a specific datatype. This is not allowed as the computer won’t be able to know what type of values it is permitted to store.</color>

Which of the following datatype would be the 
most appropriate for the following sentence:
Whether a person owns a pet.
boolean
char
string
double
<color=#757575>In this case, boolean would be the most efficient datatype to use. This is because it only accepts a value of true or false. Therefore, if the person is assigned true, it would mean that he does own a pet. Otherwise, false would mean that the person does not own a pet.</color>

What would be the output of the following pseudocodes?
1. int x <- 1
2. int y <- 4
3. int z <- 2*x + 3*y
4. print(z)
14
5
Error will occur
11
<color=#757575>Arithmetic expression works perfectly fine with variables. In this case, we will be taking 2 and multiplying it with the contents of variable x while 3 would be used to multiply with the contents of variable y. These two results are then added together and stored in z which then outputs 14.</color>

<color=#757575>First, declare the variable, word to be of String datatype as the word “Music” is a sequence of characters. After which, assign Music to it. Lastly, obtain the required output by telling the print() function to output the contents of the variable, word.</color>

Assign the given values to
their appropriate datatype
1. int <- _

3. char <- _
4. String <- _
5. boolean <- _

5342
-99.123
+
John15
False
0
<color=#757575>int will hold the value of 5342 since it is a integer. Double holds the value of -99.123 as it is a decimal number and is not affected by it being a negative number. char holds the value of + as it is a single character. String holds John15 as it is simply a sequence of characters. Lastly, boolean holds the value of false.</color>
