01 Before we start: Introduction to pseudocode@
At its simplest, codes are basically instructions for         a computer to execute. In this application, the programming concepts are taught using       <b><i>Pseudocode</i></b> instead of actual syntaxes found in programming languages.@

As the name denotes, Pseudocodes are a generic     way to represent codes in English. This allow programmers to express their intentions in an     informal and generic way before translating it into actual code. Pseudocodes are numerically indented     to show the flow of how it should be executed by a computer if it were to be written in actual code.@

For e.g. Imagine that you are trying to write a        program to record your spending in a given day.               A <b><i>Pseudocode</i></b> representation of this could be:@

   <color=#757575>1. Allow program to take in values of spending</color>@
   <color=#757575>2. Sum these inputs</color>@
   <color=#757575>3. Display total expenses for the day</color>@

02 Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions@
Having understood the premise of Pseudocode, we   can now explore our first concept. Represented in    <color=#757575>Grey</color> below, Print(1+1) is an example of a    <b><i>Pseudocode</i></b>; with the Output stating its outcome.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(1+1)</color>@
Output: 2@

In the line, Print() refers to a Function which displays whatever that is within its brackets onto the computer screen while (1+1) is the <b><i>Arithmetic Expression</i></b>. Together, <color=#757575>Print(1+1)</color> tells the computer to output the results of the arithmetic expression onto the computer screen.@

03 Common Operators@
In Programming, <b><i>Operators</i></b> are symbols that tells        the computers to perform specific mathematical or logical operations. Some commonly used <b><i>Operators</i></b> are:@

A) Addition@
<b><i>Addition</i></b> would be done using <b><color=#00BCD4>+</color></b>, for e.g.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(4+2)</color>@
Output: 6@

B) Subtraction@
<b><i>Subtraction</i></b> would be done using <b><color=#00BCD4>-</color></b>, for e.g.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(4-2)</color>@
Output: 2@

03 Common Operators@
C) Multiplication@
<b><i>Multiplication</i></b> would be done using <b><color=#00BCD4>*</color></b>, for e.g.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(4*2)</color>@
Output: 8@

D) Division@
<b><i>Division</i></b> would be done using <b><color=#00BCD4>/</color></b>, for e.g.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(4/2)</color>@
Output: 2@

E) Modulus@
<b><i>Modulus</i></b> returns the remainder of the division of         two numbers; this would be done using <b><color=#00BCD4>%</color></b>, for e.g.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(5%2)</color>@
Output: 1@

04 Operator Precedence@
Occasionally, we might want a certain operation to   take place before another. Consider the following expression:@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(2*6+3)</color>@
Output: 15@

Technically, multiplication would take place first      before the addition, but what if we wanted the     addition to take place first before the multiplication? This can be done by using brackets <b><color=#00BCD4>( )</color></b>.@

   <color=#757575>1: Print(2*(6+3))</color>@
Output: 18@
